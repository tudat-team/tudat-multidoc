    short_summary: "Base class for providing settings for automatic rotation model creation."
    extended_summary: |
      This class is a functional base class for settings of rotation models that require no information in addition to their type.
      Basic rotation model has constant orientation of the rotation axis (body-fixed z-axis) and constant rotation rate about this axis.
      Rotation models requiring additional information must be created using the factory functions which create the specific object derived from this base class.

      Factory function for settings object, defining a basic rotation model with constant orientation of the rotation axis and constant rotation rate about this axis.
      Rotation from original (inertial) to target (body-fixed) frame at some reference time ``initial_time`` is defined by the ``initial_orientation`` rotation matrix.
      Rotation about the body-fixed z-axis is defined by the ``rotation_rate`` float variable (in rad/s).
      This function creates an instance of a `RotationModelSettings` derived `simpleRotationModelSettings` object.

    extended_summary: |
      Factory function for settings object, defining a simple rotation model with the added functionality that the initial orientation and rotation rate are extracted from Spice, as opposed to provided manually.
      Note that *only* the initial orientation and rotation rate ( at the time defined by `initial_time` ) are extracted from Spice.
      The distinction between the two target frame inputs is the following

        - the ``target_frame`` parameter is the name of frame that Tudat assigns to the body-fixed frame
        - the ``target_frame_spice`` is the name of the frame in Spice for which the initial orientation and rotation rate are extracted.

  short_summary: "Factory function for creating ephemeris model settings using interpolated Spice data."
    extended summary: |
      Factory function for settings object defining an ephemeris model from interpolated Spice data.
      Using this option the state of the body is retrieved from Spice at regular intervals *before* the environment propagation (as opposed to during the propagation).
      These data are then used to create an interpolator, which is put into the environment, and called during the propagation.
      This has the advantage of only requiring calls to Spice outside of the propagation inner loop, reducing computation time in many cases (a single call to the interpolator is significantly faster that a single call to Spice).
      However, it has the downside of being applicable only during a limited time interval, and requiring the tabulated data to be stored in RAM.
      For many numerical integration scenarios, this approach may be faster than using `DirectSpiceEphemerisSettings`, with negligible influence on accuracy.
