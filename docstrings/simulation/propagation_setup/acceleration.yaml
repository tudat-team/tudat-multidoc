  - name: AccelerationSettings
    short_summary: "Functional base class to define settings for accelerations."
    extendend_summary: |
      Class for providing settings for acceleration model. This class is a functional (base) class for
      settings of acceleration models that  require no information in addition to their type.
      Classes defining settings for acceleration models requiring additional information must be derived from this class.
      Bodies exerting and undergong acceleration are set externally from this class.
      This class can be used for the easy setup of acceleration models
      (see createAccelerationModels.h), but users may also chose to do so manually.
      (Derived) Class members are all public, for ease of access and modification.

      the RSW frame.

    extended_summary: |
      Creates settings for tidal accelerations. The direct of tidal effects in a satellite system is applied directly as
      an acceleration (as opposed to a modification of spherical harmonic coefficients).
      The model is based on Lainey et al. (2007, 2012). It can compute the acceleration due to tides, and in
      particular tidal dissipation, on a planetary satellite. The acceleration computed can account for either the
      effect of tide raised on the satellite by the planet or on the planet by the satellite. The satellite is assumed
      to be tidally locked to the planet.

  # Momentum wheel desaturation
  - name: momentumWheelDesaturationAcceleration # [cpp]
  - name: momentum_wheel_desaturation_acceleration # [py]
    short_summary: "Creates settings for momentum wheel desaturation acceleration."
    extended_summary: |
      The acceleration model is purpose-built to represent short bursts of thrust, such as a momentum wheel desaturation.
      A typical use case is precise orbit determination, but the functionality can be used just as well in propagation
      (for instance to model an impulsive manuever in a continuous manner when going from preliminary modelling to
      'full' modelling). The thrust is modelled similarly to Fig. 3 of Alessi et al. (2012), with the main difference
      being that a third-order polynomial to go from zero acceleration to the maximum acceleration level is employed.
      By using a 3rd-order polynomial and imposing continuity in the value and first derivative of the acceleration,
      defining the 'rise time' (time it takes acceleration to go from 0 to its maximum level), the total time where
      there is non-zero thrust ('total maneuver time'), and the total Delta V exerted by a single maneuver,
      the acceleration profile is fully defined.

    short_summary: "Create thrust magnitude settings from a custom thrust magnitude function."
    extended_summary: |
      Factory function that creates thrust magnitude from a custom thrust magnitude function.
      This model defines a thrust force and specific impulse that can vary with time. The specific impulse is also
      provided to apply a mass rate model in the propagation the vehicle dynamics, relating the thrust to the mass
      decrease of the vehicle. Note that, if you wish to use a constant value for any or all of the first three
      arguments, lambda expression can be used. Presently, the definition of the thrust direction in the body-fixed
      frame is also defined through these derived classes. In essence, the ThrustMagnitudeSettings defines all local
      (to the vehicle systems) settings for the thrust, while ThrustDirectionGuidanceSettings defines how the full
      vehicle must orient itself in space for the required thrust direction to be achieved. At present, there is no
      direct option for thrust-vector control (i.e. modifying the thrust direction in the body-fixed frame).
