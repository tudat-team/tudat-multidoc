      the requested value of the independent variable :math:`t` in the data set :math:`[t_{0}..t_{N}]`.

  - name: lagrange_interpolation # [py]
  #- name: linearInterpolation # [cpp]
    short_summary: "Function to create settings for cubic Lagrange interpolation."
    extended_summary: |
      Function to create settings for piecewise cubic Lagrange interpolation.  This is typically the interpolator of highest accuracy that is available.
      The Lagrange interpolator uses :math:`m` consecutive points (input to this function) from the input independent variables :math:`[t_{0}...t_{N}]`
      to create the polynomial of order :math:`m-1` that interpolates these points. From here on, we assume :math:`m` is even.
      The algorithm that is used (see `here <https://mathworld.wolfram.com/LagrangeInterpolatingPolynomial.html>`_ for mathematical details
      on interpolating Lagrange polynomials) works as follows:

      * The nearest lower neighbor of the data point :math:`t` at which the state :math:`\mathbf{x}` is to be interpolated is determined, and denoted :math:`t_{i}`.
      * An interpolating Lagrange polynomial is constructed from the consecutive data points :math:`[t_{i-(m/2-1)}...t_{i+m}]`
      * This resulting interpolating polynomial is *only* used in the interval :math:`[t_{i}..t_{i+1}]`, to prevent `Runge's phenomenon <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%27s_phenomenon>`_.

      For instance, if :math:`m=8` we use a :math:`7^{th}` order polynomial that interpolates a contiguous set of
      8 data points out of the full data set. Normally, the interpolating polynomial is only used between the
      :math:`4^{th}` and :math:`5^{th}` data point, where it will typically be of good accuracy. Consequently,
      a separate interpolating polynomial (using data over a span of :math:`m` consecutive points) is used for
      each single interval :math:`[t_{i}..t_{i+1}]` (with the exception of the boundaries, see below).

      .. warning:: Issues can occur if the data point :math:`t` at which the interpolation is to be
                   performed is close to :math:`t_{0}` or :math:`t_{N}`. In those case, there is not sufficient
                   data to construct the interpolating polynomial *and* to only use this interpolating polynomial
                   between the middle two data points that were used to it. In these cases, the user has a number of
                   options (all defined by an entry of the :class:`LagrangeInterpolatorBoundaryHandling` variable,
                   used as input to this function). In short, interpolation between the first and last :math:`m/2`
                   data points will lead to degraded results, warnings, or termination.
