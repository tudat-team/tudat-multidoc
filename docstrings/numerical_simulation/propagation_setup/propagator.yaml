  # Time termination
  - name: propagationTimeTerminationSettings # [cpp]
  - name: time_termination # [py]
    short_summary: "Factory function to create time termination settings for the propagation."
    extended_summary: |
      Factory function to create time termination settings for the propagation.
      The propagation is stopped when the final time provided is reached. Note that the termination time is set as the
      absolute time (in seconds since J2000), not the time since the start of the propagation.
      Depending on the sign of the time step of the numerical integrator, the termination time will be treated as an
      upper bound (for positive time step) or lower bound (for negative time step).
      The simulator will normally finish the final time-step, which may cause the termination time to be slightly exceeded.
      This behaviour can be suppressed by providing the optional input argument
      ``terminate_exactly_on_final_condition=True``, in which case the final propagation step will be *exactly* on the
      specified time.

    notes: |
      To reach *exactly* the final time, state derivative function evaluations beyond the final
      time may be required by the propagator. Reaching the final condition exactly is an iterative process and
      very minor deviations from the specified final condition can occur.

    parameters:

      The propagation is stopped when a provided upper or lower limit value is reached.
      The simulator will normally finish the final time-step, which may cause the dependent variable to be slightly exceeded.
      This behaviour can be suppressed by providing the optional input argument

    examples: |

      in the ``termination_settings``. The propagation is terminated once the *lower* limit of 25 km in altitude is
      reached (as the ``use_as_lower_limit`` is set to ``True``). To use the above settings to terminate when an
      *upper* limit of 25 km is reached, set this boolean to ``False``. In this example, we also want to stop exactly
      at 25 km, so we set ``terminate_exactly_on_final_condition`` to ``True``, and we specify ``termination_root_finder_settings``.
