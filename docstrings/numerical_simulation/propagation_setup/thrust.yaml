    extended_summary: |
      Factory function that creates thrust magnitude from a custom thrust magnitude function.
      This model defines a thrust force and specific impulse that can vary with time. The specific impulse is also
      provided to apply a mass rate model in the propagation the vehicle dynamics, relating the thrust to the mass
      decrease of the vehicle. Note that, if you wish to use a constant value for any or all of the first three
      arguments, lambda expression can be used. Presently, the definition of the thrust direction in the body-fixed
      frame is also defined through these derived classes. In essence, the ThrustMagnitudeSettings defines all local
      (to the vehicle systems) settings for the thrust, while ThrustDirectionGuidanceSettings defines how the full
      vehicle must orient itself in space for the required thrust direction to be achieved. At present, there is no
      direct option for thrust-vector control (i.e. modifying the thrust direction in the body-fixed frame).
