    extended_summary: |
      Coefficient sets for Runge-Kutta-type integrators. The coefficients are defined
      in a Butcher Tableau, with an coefficient set yielding an x(y) method yielding an integrator
      with global truncation error of :math:`O(\Delta t^{x})`. Some of these coefficients also contain an embedded integrator of :math:`O(\Delta t^{y})`
      for step size control.
