        description: |
          Numerical solution of the equations of motion as key-value pairs. The key denotes the epoch. The value contains the
          numerically calculated state at this epoch. For this function, the states are always converted to so-called
          'conventional' formulations (e.g. Cartesian states for translational dynamics), see `here <https://tudat-space.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_src_api/propagation_setup/settings/conventional_vs_propagated_coordinates.html>`_
          for detailed. For the history of the states that were actually propagated, use the ``unprocessed_state_history``.

          .. note:: The propagated state at each epoch contains the state types in the following order: Translational ( **C** ), Rotational ( **R** ), Mass ( **M** ), and Custom ( **C** ).
                    When propagating two bodies, an example of what the output state would look like is for instance:
                    [ **T** Body 1, **T** Body 2, **R** Body 1, **R** Body 2, **M** Body 1, **M** Body 2 ]

          .. note:: For propagation of translational dynamics using cowell
                    propagator, the conventional and propagated
                    coordinates are identical.

          Raw numerical solution of the equations of motion as key-value pairs. The key denotes the epoch. The value contains the
          numerically calculated state at this epoch. This attribute contains the states of the propagated bodies expressed in the
          "raw" form in which the propagation took place. For instance, when using a Gauss-Kepler propagation scheme, this
          attribute will contain the numerically propagated Keplerian elements at each time epoch

              Boolean defining whether the propagation should be

              Boolean defining whether the propagation results should be
              deleted after the propagation is terminated. If this is

              from this objects, but the results are used to update the

              Boolean defining whether the propagation results are to
              be used to update the environment. If this variable is set

              retrieved from this object (provided the
              :py:attr:`~clear_numerical_solutions` is set to False),
              but the (for instance) Ephemeris of the propagated body
              is not updated with the propagation results. If this
              variable is set to True, the properties of the propagated
              :class:`~tudatpy.numerical_simulation.environment.Body`
              object will be updated as per the numerical results.
              Depending on the state type, this will result in:
                 - **Translational**: The ephemeris of the propagated body
                   will be updated.

                   .. note:: This requires the propagated body to be
                             endowed with a tabulated ephemeris.

                 - **Rotational**: The rotational ephemeris of the
                   propagated body will be updated.
