    extended_summary: |
      Function to create object that propagates the dynamics, as specified by propagator settings, and the physical environment.
      Depending on the specific input type (e.g. which factory function from the :ref:`\`\`propagator\`\`` module was used),
      a single-, multi- or hybrid-arc simulator is created. The environment is typically created by the :func:`~tudatpy.numerical_simulation.environment_setup.create_system_of_bodies`
      function. When using default settings, calling this function will automatically propagate the dynamics.
    parameters:

    - name: bodies # [py]
      type: :class:`~tudatpy.numerical_simulation.environment.SystemOfBodies` # [py]n
      description: |
        Object defining the physical environment, with all
        properties of artificial and natural bodies.

    - name: propagator_settings # [py]
      type: :class:`~tudatpy.numerical_simulation.propagation_setup.propagator.PropagatorSettings` # [py]
      description: |
        Settings to be used for the numerical propagation (dynamics type, termination conditions, integrator, etc.)

    - name: simulate_dynamics_on_creation # [py]
      type: Bool, default=True # [py]
      description: |
        Boolean defining whether to propagate the dynamics upon creation of the Simulator. If false, the dynamics c
        can be propagated at a later time by calling the :class:`~tudatpy.numerical_simulation.Simulator.integrate_equations_of_motion` function

    returns:
      type: :class:`~tudatpy.numerical_simulation.Simulator` # [py]
      description: Object that propagates the dynamics, and processes the results. # [py]
