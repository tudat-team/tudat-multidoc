      Factory function for creating settings for first-order relativistic light-time corrections: the correction to
      the light time of a (set of) stationary point masses, computed up to c−2 according to general relativity as formulated by e.g. Moyer (2000).
      One ambiguity in the model is the time at which the states of the perturbing bodies are evaluated. We distinguish two cases:

      * In the case where the perturbing body contains a link end of the observation (for instance perturbation due to Earth gravity field,
        with one of the link ends being an Earth-based station), the time at which the Earth’s state is evaluated equals the transmission time if Earth acts as transmitter, and reception time if
        Earth acts as receiver.
      * In other cases, where the perturbing body is not involved in the link ends, its state is evaluated at the midpoint time between transmitter and receiver.

    extended_summary: |
      Factory function for creating observation model settings of one-way range type observables, for a single link definition. The associated observation model creates
      a single-valued observable :math:`h_{_{\text{1-range}}}` as follows (in the unbiased case):
      
      .. math::
         h_{_{\text{1-range}}}(t_{R},t_{T})=|\mathbf{r}_{R}(t_{R})-\mathbf{r}_{T}(t_{T})| + \Delta s
      
      where :math:`\mathbf{r}_{R}`, :math:`\mathbf{r}_{T}`, :math:`t_{R}` and :math:`t_{T}` denote the position function of receiver and transmitter, and evaluation time 
      of receiver and transmitter. The term :math:`\Delta s` denotes light-time corrections due to e.g relativistic, atmospheric effects (as defined by the ``light_time_correction_settings`` input).
      The transmission and reception time are related to the light-time :math:`T=t_{R}-t_{T}`, which is in turn related to the one-way range as :math:`T=h/c`
      As a result, the calculation of the one-way range (and light-time) requires the iterative solution of the equation:

    short_summary: "Factory function for creating settings for a two-way instantaneous Doppler observable."
    extended_summary: |

      Factory function for creating settings for a two-way instantaneous Doppler observable for a single link definition. The associated observation model creates
      a single-valued observable :math:`h_{_{\text{2-Dopp.}}}` as follows (in the unbiased case), by combining the up- and downlink one-way 
      instantanenous Doppler observable :math:`h_{_{\text{1-Dopp.}}}` 
      (both normalized by speed of light c, see :func:`~tudatpy.numerical_simulation.estimation_setup.observation.one_way_doppler_instantaneous`) as follows:
    
      .. math::
         h_{_{\text{2-Dopp.}}}=c\left((\left(h_{_{\text{1-Dopp.}}}\right)_{\text{up}}+1)(\left(h_{_{\text{1-Dopp.}}}\right)_{\text{down}}+1)-1\right)

      The resulting observable is non-dimensional (but can be converted to an observed range-rate by multiplying with speed of light :math:`c`)

      This observable represents the 'instantaneous (non-integrated)' Doppler observable, as obtained from open-loop observations.
      It should *not* be used for the modelling of the typical closed-loop observations used in deep space tracking (for which the 
      :func:`~tudatpy.numerical_simulation.estimation_setup.observation.two_way_doppler_averaged` should be used)

      The observable may be non-dimensionalized by the speed of light :math:`c`,
      which results in the observable being equal to the received and transmitted signal frequencies :math:`f_{R}/f_{T}-1`.

      When simulating observations, these settings ensure that any applicable observations, for which the signal path passes 'too close' to a body, will be omitted.
      The definition of 'too close' is computed as the angle between:

      * The line-of-sight vector from a link end to a given third body
      * The line-of-sight between two link ends

      This constraint is typically used to prevent the Sun from being too close to the field-of-view of the telescope(s), as defined by
      a so-called 'SPE' (Sun-Probe-Earth) angle constraint. The present viability setting generalizes this constraint.

  - name: continuous_arc_simulation_settings # [py]

    short_summary: "Factory function for creating settings object for observation simulation, using observation times according to a requirement for a continuous tracking arc."
    extended_summary: |
      Factory function for creating settings object for observation simulation. Unlike the :func:`~tudatpy.numerical_simulation.estimation_setup.observation.tabulated_simulation_settings`
      function, the resulting settings do not define the observation times explicitly. Instead, this settings object determines the observation times adaptively during the
      simulation of the observation, with the requirement that observations should be simulated over a set of contiguous arcs (if possible). The exact algorithm meets the following conditions:

      * Observations are only simulated within the time span of ``start_time`` and ``end_time``
      * A contiguous tracking arc has simulated observations separated by ``interval_between_observations``
      * Starting from ``start_time``, an observation is simulated each ``interval_between_observations``. Once an observation is unviable, as defined by
        the ``arc_limiting_constraints`` input, it is checked whether the arc up until that point 
        is longer in duration than ``minimum_arc_duration``. If it is, the arc is added to the simulated observations. If not, the arc is discarded. In either case, a new arc is started once a 
        viable is observation is encountered
      * If the current arc reaching a duration greater than ``maximum_arc_duration``, the arc is added to the existing observations, and a new arc is started
      * If defined (e.g. if not NaN), the current observation time is incremented by ``minimum_time_between_arcs`` when an arc has been added to the observations.

      Nominally, this algorithm ensures that any arc of observations has a minimum and maximum duration. In addition, it ensures that (if desired) there is a minimum time interval 
      between two tracking arcs. This behaviour can be modified by adding ``additional_viability_settings``, which are *not* used when computing the tracking arcs, but which are instead only used
      to reduce the set of simulated observations afterwards.

      #Function for including the computation and reporting of dependent variables into the observation simulation settings of one or more observable(s).
      #Note: The associated functionality is not yet mature enough for the end user. Function is exposed for development purposes only.

  ##   Modifications are applied to all given :class:`~tudatpy.numerical_simulation.estimation_setup.observation.ObservationSimulationSettings` object(s),
  ##   matching each :class:`~tudatpy.numerical_simulation.estimation_setup.observation.ObservationSimulationSettings` object with the corresponding :class:`ObservationDependentVariableSettings` entry in the `dependent_variable_settings` parameter.
  ##   Note that the :class:`~tudatpy.numerical_simulation.estimation_setup.observation.ObservationSimulationSettings` objects are modified in-place and thus the function does not return anything.

  ## parameters:
  ##   - name: observation_simulation_settings # [py]
  ##     type: List[ :class:`~tudatpy.numerical_simulation.estimation_setup.observation.ObservationSimulationSettings` ]
  ##     description: Observation simulation settings, given by a list of one or more existing :class:`~tudatpy.numerical_simulation.estimation_setup.observation.ObservationSimulationSettings` objects.

  ##   - name: dependent_variable_settings # [py]
  ##     type: List[ :class:`~tudatpy.numerical_simulation.estimation_setup.observation.ObservationDependentVariableSettings` ] # [py]
  ##     description: |
  ##       List of one or more :class:`~tudatpy.numerical_simulation.estimation_setup.observation.ObservationDependentVariableSettings` objects, defining the dependent variables to be considered.

  ##   - name: bodies # [py]
  ##     type: :class:`~tudatpy.numerical_simulation.environment_setup.SystemOfBodies` # [py]
  ##     description: |
  ##       Object consolidating all bodies and environment models that constitute the physical environment.

  ## returns:
  ##   type: None  # [py]
  ##   description: |
  ##     The :class:`~tudatpy.numerical_simulation.estimation_setup.observation.ObservationSimulationSettings` object(s) are changed in-place.
