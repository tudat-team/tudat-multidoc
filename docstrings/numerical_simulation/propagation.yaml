summary : "Functionalities and utilities of propagation objects."

extended_summary: |
  This module provides functionalities for propagation settings
  objects. It also contains some utility functions that extract specific quantities from propagation settings and body
  objects. Note that the classes in this module are rarely created manually, 
  but are instead created by the functionality in the :ref:`\`\`propagation_setup\`\``  module. 

enums:
  - name: PropagationTerminationReason
    short_summary: "Enumeration of types of termination of propagation."

    members:
      - name: propagation_never_run
      - name: unknown_reason
      - name: termination_condition_reached
      - name: runtime_error_caught_in_propagation
      - name: nan_or_inf_detected_in_state

classes:

  - name: PropagationTerminationDetails
    short_summary: |
       Object that provides information on the reason for the
       termination of the propagation.

    properties: # [py]
      - name: termination_reason # [py]
        type: PropagationTerminationReason # [py]
        description: | # [py]
          Enum defining the reason the propagation was terminated

      - name: terminated_on_exact_condition # [py]
        type: bool # [py]
        description: | # [py]
          Boolean defining whether the propagation was terminated on an *exact* final condition,
          or once the propagation went *past* the determined final condition. The choice of behaviour is
          defined by the termination settings provided as input to the Simulator object. This variable only
          has a meaningful definition if the ``termination_reason`` has value ``termination_condition_reached``

functions:


  - name: getInitialStatesOfBodies # [cpp]
  - name: get_state_of_bodies # [py]
    short_summary: "Function to get the states of a set of bodies, with respect to some set of central bodies, at the requested time."

    extended_summary: |

        type: std::vector<std::string> # [cpp]
      - name: central_bodies # [py]
        type: list[str] # [py]

  # Free function
  - name: createCombinedInitialState # [cpp]
  - name: combine_initial_states # [py]
    short_summary: "Function to retrieve the initial state for a list of propagator settings."
    extended_summary: |
      Function to retrieve the initial state for a list of propagator settings. This way, the initial state for
      different quantities to be propagated (e.g., translational state, rotational state, mass) are retrieved and
      organized in a single container.

    parameters:
      - name: propagatorSettingsList # [cpp]
        type: map # [cpp]
      - name: propagator_settings_per_type # [py]
        type: dict # [py]
        description: Propagator settings where the type of propagation is reported as key and the respective list of propagator settings as value.

    returns:
        type: Eigen::Matrix # [cpp]
        type: numpy.ndarray # [py]
        description: Vector of initial states, sorted in order of IntegratedStateType, and then in the order of the vector of SingleArcPropagatorSettings of given type.
