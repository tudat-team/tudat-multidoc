summary : "Functionalities of environment objects."

extended_summary: |
  This module provides functionalities for environment objects. Specifically, it contains
  classes and functions that perform computations related to environment models of natural and artificial bodies.
  Much of the functionality in this module concerns classes stored inside :class:`~tudatpy.numerical_simulation.environment.Body` objects, a list of which is in turn
  stored in a :class:`~tudatpy.numerical_simulation.environment.SystemOfBodies` object. Note that the classes in this module are rarely created manually, 
  but are instead created by the functionality in the :ref:`\`\`environment_setup\`\`` module. 


enums:

    extended_summary: |
      Enumeration of reference frame identifiers typical for aerodynamic calculations. Note that the frames are also defined
      in the absence of any aerodynamic forces and/or atmosphere. They define frames of a body w.r.t. a central body, with
      the details given by Mooij (1994). The chain of frames starts from the inertial frame, to the frame fixed to the
      central body (corotating), to the vertical frame (defined by the body's relative position), the trajectory and aerodynamic frames
      (defined by the body's relative velocity) and finally the body's own body-fixed frame.

    short_summary: |

       a single body.
    extended_summary: |
       Object that stores the environment properties and current state
       of a single celestial body (natural or artificial). Each separate
       environment model (gravity field, ephemeris, etc.) is stored as a
       member object in this class. During each time step, the Body gets
       updated to the current time/propagated state, and the current
       properties, in as much as they are time-dependent, can be
       extracted from this object

          The translational state of the Body, as set during the current

          stored here is always in Cartesian elements, w.r.t. the global
          frame origin, with axes along the global frame orientation. If
          the body's translational state is numerically propagated, this
          property gets extracted from the propagated state vector. If it
          is not propagated, the state is extracted from this body's
          ephemeris. In both cases, any required state transformations
          are automatically applied. Note that this function  is *only*
          valid during the numerical propagation if any aspects of the

          The rotation from inertial frame (with global frame
          orientation) to this Body's body-fixed frame. The rotation is

          rotational state is numerically propagated, this property gets
          extracted from the propagated state vector. If it is not
          propagated, the state is extracted from this body's rotational
          ephemeris.

          Denotes the current mass of the vehicle, as used in the calculation of

          does *not* define a gravity field (this is done through a gravity field model).
          However, defining a gravity field model in a body automatically assigns it
          a mass here.
          Unlike the attributes containing the state, orientation, angular velocity
          of the Body, this attribute may be used to retrieve the state during the

        short_summary: "This function creates a new empty body."
        extended_summary: |
          This function creates a new empty body, and adds it to the
          :py:class:`~SystemOfBodies`. Since the body is empty, it will
          not have any environment models defined. These must all be
          added manually by a user.

        examples: |

          This function is often used early on in the environment
          creation segment of a simulation, following the creation of
          a :py:class:`~SystemOfBodies` from the default settings
          for celestial bodies.

    short_summary: "Function to save the mesh used for a hypersonic local inclination analysis to a file."
    extended_summary: |
      Function to save the mesh used for a hypersonic local inclination analysis to a file. This function saves 
      two files to the specified directory, with filenames: "ShapeFile.dat" and "SurfaceNormalFile.dat", where these
      files names may be prefixed by an optional string (see below). The first of these files contains four columns defining
      the surface points that define mesh, with Column 0: point index; Column 1: x-position of point; Column 1: y-position of point; 
      Column 2: z-position of point. The second file contains four columns with Column 0: point index; Column 1: x-component of surface normal; 
      Column 1: y-position of surface normal; Column 2: z-position of surface normal.
