    examples: |
      In this example, we create a :class:`~tudatpy.numerical_simulation.environment_setup.shape.BodyShapeModel` using a perfectly oblate spherical shape model:

      .. code-block:: python # [py]
         # [py]
         # define parameters describing oblate spherical model # [py]
         body_radius = 6378.0E3 # [py]
         body_flattening = 1.0 / 300.0 # [py]
         # create shape model settings  # [py]
         body_settings.get( "Earth" ).shape_settings = environment_setup.shape.oblate_spherical( body_radius, body_flattening ) # [py]

      .. code-block:: cpp # [cpp]
         # [cpp]
         // define parameters describing oblate spherical model # [cpp]
         double bodyRadius = 6378.0E3; # [cpp]

  - name: polyhedron # [py]

    short_summary: "Factory function for creating a polyhedron body shape model settings."
    extended_summary: |
      Factory function for settings object, defining a polyhedron shape model.

      Note: The evaluation of the altitude with a polyhedron model tends to be computationally expensive. To reduce the
      computational time, it might be useful to instead define a hybrid shape model (see
      :func:`~tudatpy.numerical_simulation.environment_setup.shape.hybrid`), which allows using a high-resolution
      polyhedron (with a large number of facets) at low altitudes and a low-resolution one (with smaller number of facets)
      at high-altitudes.

    parameters:
      - name: vertices_coordinates # [py]
        type: numpy.ndarray # [py]
      - name: verticesCoordinates # [cpp]
        type: Eigen::MatrixXd # [cpp]
        description: |
          Cartesian coordinates of each polyhedron vertex. Entry (i,j) denotes vertex i, coordinate j (one
          row per vertex, 3 columns).

      - name: vertices_defining_each_facet # [py]
        type: numpy.ndarray # [py]
      - name: verticesDefiningEachFacet # [cpp]
        type: Eigen::MatrixXi # [cpp]
        description: |
          Index (0 based) of the vertices constituting each facet. Entry (i,j) denotes facet i, and the jth vertex of
          the facet (one row per facet, 3 columns). In each row, the vertices' indices should be ordered counterclockwise
          when seen from the outside of the polyhedron.

        type: bool, default=True # [py]
      - name: computeAltitudeWithSign # [cpp]
        type: bool, default=true # [cpp]
        description: |
          Flag indicating whether the altitude should be computed with sign (i.e. >0 if above surface, <0 otherwise) or
          having always a positive value. If the the sign of the altitude is not relevant, then setting it to *false* is
          recommended, as it reduces the CPU time.

      - name: just_compute_distance_to_vertices # [py]
        type: bool, default=False # [py]
      - name: justComputeDistanceToVertices # [cpp]
        type: bool, default=false # [cpp]
        description: |
          Flag indicating whether the altitude should be computed just with respect to the polyhedron vertices (if flag
          is set to *true*) or to all polyhedron features (vertices, facets and edges; happens if flag is set to
          *false*). Depending on the application, it might be useful to set the flag to *true* for medium to high
          altitudes, as it allows significantly reducing the CPU time (the resulting altitude errors depend on the
          resolution of the used polyhedron and altitude itself).

  - name: hybrid # [py]

    short_summary: "Factory function for creating hybrid body shape model settings."
    extended_summary: |
      Factory function for settings object, defining a hybrid shape model.

      The hybrid shape model is constituded by two shape models: a low-resolution model which is used at high altitudes
      (above the switchover altitude) and a high-resolution model used at low altitudes (below the switchover altitude).
      In each computation of the altitude, the altitude is first computed with the low-resolution model. The
      low-resolution altitude is then compared to the switchover altitude to decide whether to compute the high-resolution
      altitude.

      The hybrid shape model is useful when the evaluation of the high-resolution model is computationally expensive
      (e.g. polyhedron model).

      - name: low_resolution_body_shape_settings # [py]
        type: BodyShapeSettings # [py]

          Settings of the shape model that is to be used to compute the altitude at low altitudes (below the switchover

        description: |
          Altitude at which the model used to compute the altitude is changed. The high-resolution model is used for
          altitudes below the switchover altitude, the low-resolution model for altitudes above it.
