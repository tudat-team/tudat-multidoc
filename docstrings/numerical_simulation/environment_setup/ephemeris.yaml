    examples: |
      In this example, we create barycentric (origin: SSB) :class:`~tudatpy.numerical_simulation.environment_setup.ephemeris.EphemerisSettings` with axes along J2000, using data directly from spice:

         bodySettings[ "Jupiter" ]->ephemerisSettings = std::make_shared< DirectSpiceEphemerisSettings >( frameOrigin, frameOrientation ); # [cpp]

      Alternatively, we can assign the DirectSpiceEphemerisSettings of Jupiter (or any other body for which a direct Spice ephemeris is available) to any custom body:

    short_summary: "Factory function for creating ephemeris model settings using interpolated Spice data."
    extended_summary: |
      Factory function for settings object defining an ephemeris model from interpolated Spice data.
      Using this option the state of the body is retrieved from Spice at regular intervals `before` the environment propagation (as opposed to during the propagation).
      These data are then used to create an interpolator, which is put into the environment, and called during the propagation.
      This option has the downside of being applicable only during a limited time interval and requiring the tabulated data to be stored in RAM,
      but may for `some special cases <https://tudat-space.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_src_user_guide/environment_setup/valid_time_range.html>`_
      offer an advantage over a direct Spice ephemeris (:func:`~tudatpy.numerical_simulation.environment_setup.ephemeris.direct_spice`).

    examples: |
      In this example, we define :class:`~tudatpy.numerical_simulation.environment_setup.ephemeris.EphemerisSettings` for Jupiter by retrieving ephemeris data from Spice at 3600 s intervals between t=0 and t=1.0E8:

      .. code-block:: python # [py]
        # [py]
        # Define the interpolation settings
        initial_time = 0.0 # [py]
        final_time = 1.0E8 # [py]
        time_step = 3600.0 # [py]
        # Define the ephemeris frame
        frame_origin = "SSB" # [py]
        frame_orientation = "J2000" # [py]
        # create ephemeris settings and add to body settings of body "Jupiter"
        body_settings.get( "Jupiter" ).ephemeris_settings = environment_setup.ephemeris.interpolated_spice( # [py]
          initial_time, final_time, time_step, frame_origin, frame_orientation ) # [py]

      # cpp code snippet unavailable # [cpp]

      By default, a 6th order Lagrange interpolator is used (NOTE: the Lagrange interpolator is not reliable at the edges of the interpolation interval, as discussed `here <https://tudat-space.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_src_user_guide/mathematics.html#lagrange-interpolator-issues>`_).
      Settings for an alternative interpolator can be use by specifying the optional input argument.
      Additionally, as is the case for the :func:`~tudatpy.numerical_simulation.environment_setup.ephemeris.direct_spice` and :func:`~tudatpy.numerical_simulation.environment_setup.ephemeris.approximate_jpl_model` functions, an optional input argument ``body_name_to_use`` allows to use an ephemeris model from Spice for some body and assign it to a custom body.

    extended_summary: |
      Factory function for creating tabulated ephemeris model settings from existing ephemeris.
      The ephemeris that is provided gets tabulated in a given time frame, for a given time step.
      When called, this tabulated ephemeris will use interpolation, when needed, from the specified interpolator.

      .. note:: Creating tabulated ephemeris from existing ephemeris can for instance be used when combined with estimation.
                This is because estimation needs the ephemeris to be tabulated to work.

    parameters:
      - name: ephemeris_settings # [py]
        type: tudatpy.numerical_simulation.environment_setup.ephemeris.EphemerisSettings # [py]
        description: Existing ephemeris settings that have to be tabulated. # [py]

      - name: start_time # [py]
        type: float # [py]
        description: Initial time for which to create the tabulated ephemeris.

      - name: end_time # [py]
        type: float # [py]
        description: Final time for which to create the tabulated ephemeris.

      - name: time_step # [py]
        type: float # [py]
        description: Time step to use to tabulate the existing ephemeris.

      - name: interpolator_settings # [py]
        type: tudatpy.math.interpolators.InterpolatorSettings, default=tudatpy.math.interpolators.lagrange_interpolation(8) # [py]
        description: Interpolator settings to use when interpolating between two tabulated ephemeris.

    returns:
        type: TabulatedEphemerisSettings
        description: Instance of the :class:`~tudatpy.numerical_simulation.environment_setup.ephemeris.EphemerisSettings` derived :class:`~tudatpy.numerical_simulation.environment_setup.ephemeris.TabulatedEphemerisSettings` class


    examples: |
      In this example, we create :class:`~tudatpy.numerical_simulation.environment_setup.ephemeris.EphemerisSettings` for Io.
      First, we extract the existing ephemeris. Then, we define new tabulated ephemeris settings, from the original settings.

      .. code-block:: python # [py]
        # [py]
        # Get the original ephemeris settings # [py]
        original_io_ephemeris_settings = body_settings.get( "Io" ).ephemeris_settings # [py]
        # Apply new tabulated ephemeris settings # [py]
        body_settings.get( "Io" ).ephemeris_settings =  environment_setup.ephemeris.tabulated_from_existing( # [py]
          original_io_ephemeris_settings, # [py]
          initial_time, # [py]
          final_time, # [py]
          time_step ) # [py]
