      This function creates the actual coefficient interface from these settings, and assigns it to the
      selected body. In addition to the identifier for the body to which it is assigned, this function
      requires the full :class:`~tudatpy.numerical_simulation.environment.SystemOfBodies` as input, to facilitate

      This function can be used to add an radiation pressure interface to an existing body. It requires
      settings for the radiation pressure interface, created using one of the factory functions from the :ref:`~tudatpy.numerical_simulation_environment_setup.radiation_pressure` module.
      This function creates the actual coefficient interface from these settings, and assigns it to the

    short_summary: "Function that creates a flight conditions, and adds it to an existing body."
    extended_summary: |
      This function can be used to add  a :class:`~tudatpy.numerical_simulation.environment.FlightConditions` object to an existing body.
      Typically, the ``FlightConditions`` are created automatically when they are required (for the calulcation of an
      aerodynamic acceleration, or the saving of certain dependent variables). However, in some cases it may be useful
      to manually trigger their creation, which is done through this function. If the ``central_body_name`` input
      denotes a body that is endowed with an :class:`~tudatpy.numerical_simulation.environment.AtmosphereModel`, this function
      automically creates an :class:`~tudatpy.numerical_simulation.environment.AtmosphericFlightConditions` object (capable of
      calculating density, speed of sound, etc.), instead of the more basic :class:`~tudatpy.numerical_simulation.environment.FlightConditions`
      (which is limited to properties such as altitude, latitude, etc.)
