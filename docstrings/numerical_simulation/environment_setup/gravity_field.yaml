    short_summary: "Factory function for creating a spherical harmonics gravity field settings object."
    extended_summary: |
      Factory function for settings object, defining a gravity field model through spherical harmonic expansion.
      The ``associated_reference_frame`` must be the same frame ID as the target frame of the body’s rotation model.
      It represents the frame in which the spherical harmonic field is defined.
      
      The gravitational potential is the defined as:

      .. math::
         U(\mathbf{r})=\sum_{l=0}^{l_{max}}\sum_{m=0}^{l}\mu\left(\frac{{R}^{l}}{r^{l+1}}\right)\bar{P}_{lm}(\sin\phi)\left(\bar{C}_{lm}\cos m\theta+\bar{S}_{lm}\sin m\theta\right)

      with :math:`\mathbf{r}` the position vector of the evaluation point, measured from the body's center of mass. The angles :math:`\phi` and :math:`\theta` are the body-fixed latitude and longitude of the evaluation point, and :math:`\bar{P}_{lm}` is the associated Legendre polynomial (at degree/order :math`l/m`).

      Note: Spherical harmonic coefficients used for this environment model must *always* be fully normalized.

    short_summary: "Factory function for creating a polyhedron gravity field settings object, using the gravitational parameter."
    extended_summary: |
      Factory function for settings object, defining a gravity field model through a polyhedron.
      The ``associated_reference_frame`` must be the same frame ID as the target frame of the body’s rotation model.
      It represents the frame in which the polyhedron field is defined. 

      The gravitational potential, acceleration, Laplacian of potential and Hessian of potential are computed according
      to Werner and Scheeres [2]_.
