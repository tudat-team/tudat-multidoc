  #################        COVARIANCES       ################################

  - name: propagate_covariance # [py]
    short_summary: "Function to propagate system covariance through time."
    extended_summary: |
      Function to propagate the covariance of a given system through time.
      The system dynamics and numerical settings of the propagation are prescribed by the `state_transition_interface` parameter.

    parameters:

      - name: initial_covariance # [py]
        type: numpy.ndarray[numpy.float64[m, n]] # [py]
        description: |
          System covariance matrix (symmetric and positive semi-definite) at initial time.
          Dimensions have to be consistent with estimatable parameters in the system (specified by `state_transition_interface`)

      - name: state_transition_interface # [py]
        type: :class:`~tudatpy.numerical_simulation.estimation.CombinedStateTransitionAndSensitivityMatrixInterface` # [py]
        description: |
          Interface to the variational equations of the system dynamics, handling the propagation of the covariance matrix through time.

      - name: output_times # [py]
        type: List[ float ] # [py]
        description: |
          Times at which the propagated covariance matrix shall be reported.
          Note that this argument has no impact on the integration time-steps of the covariance propagation,
          which always adheres to the integrator settings that the `state_transition_interface` links to.
          Output times which do not coincide with integration time steps are calculated via interpolation.

    returns:
      type: Dict[ float, numpy.ndarray[numpy.float64[m, n]] ]  # [py]
      description: Dictionary reporting the propagated covariances at each output time.

    short_summary: "Function to propagate system formal errors through time."
    extended_summary: |
      Function to propagate the formal errors of a given system through time.
      Note that in practice the entire covariance matrix is propagated, but only the formal errors (variances) are reported at the output times.
      The system dynamics and numerical settings of the propagation are prescribed by the `state_transition_interface` parameter.
