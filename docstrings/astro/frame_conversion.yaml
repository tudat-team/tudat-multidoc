summary: |
  Conversions between different reference frames.

extended_summary: |
  This module provide a variety of functions and classes to convert
  between different reference frames. Functionality to convert between
  different state representations is provided in the
  :ref:`\`\`element_conversion\`\`` module.

notes: |
  - All reference frames used should be assumed as right handed:
    :math:`\mathbf{X}\times\mathbf{Y}=\mathbf{Z}`.

  - We distinguish between two different uses of the term 'inertial:

    * An *inertial origin*: the frame has a non-accelerating origin. On solar
      system scales, the solar system barycenter (SSB) is considered to be 
      the only inertial origin.
    * An *inertial orientation*: the unit axes of the frame are non-rotating
      with respect to the celestial background. This module is concerned 
      primarily with conversions between different orientations.

  - Examples of and inertial origin include J2000 (a.k.a EME2000), as
    well as the SPICE-defined ECLIPJ2000 frame (see `this description <https://tudat-space.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_src_user_guide/environment_setup/use_of_reference_frames.html#predefined-orientations>`_
    on our user guide). The use of the ICRF frame (difference from J2000
    is <0.1 arcseconds) in Tudat is presently limited to the
    :ref:`\`\`numerical_simulation\`\`` model, see
    :func:`~tudatpy.numerical_simulation.environment_setup.rotation_model.gcrs_to_itrs`.

      Function to compute the rotation matrix from inertial to RSW frame.
      The RSW frame is defined  by the state of a body w.r.t. to some
      central body. The x-axis of the RSW frame points away from the
      origin, and the y-axis lies in the orbital plane, and is positive
      for in the direction of the velocity vector (but is not colinear
      with the velocity vector, except for circular orbits). The z-axis
      is perpendicular to the orbital plane, and completes the
      right-handed coordinate system.
