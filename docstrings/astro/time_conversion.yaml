summary: |
  Conversions and computation on date and time.

extended_summary: |
  This module provide a variety of functions to convert times and dates from Julian Dates, calendar dates and epochs.
  Conversion between different time scales (UTC, TDB, TT, etc.) are also possible. Conversions between time scales make extensive use of the SOFA library.
  Different helper functions are also included to ease the most common operation on dates and times.

notes: |
 * Unless specified otherwise, the time used in Tudatpy is in seconds since J2000, noon on the 1st of January 2000 (e.g., this epoch defines :math:`t=0`)
 * Tudat uses two different classes for date and time. One is the regular ``datetime`` from the Python ``datetime`` library. The other is a Tudat-native :class:`Datetime` class, which allows finer resolution for time definitions, and allows for easier convesion to time representations (seconds since epoch, Julian day, modified Julian day). You can convert between the two using the :func:`datetime_to_tudat` and :func:`datetime_to_python` functions.

    examples: |
      In this example, the calendar date of the 17th of February 2022, at 15:41 and 2 seconds is first converted to Julian seconds since J2000.
      Then, this date and time is converted from the TCB scale to the TDB scale.

      .. code-block:: python

        # Define the date and time
        date = datetime.datetime(2022, 2, 17, 15, 41, 2)
        # Convert it in Julian days since J2000
        date_J2000 = time_conversion.calendar_date_to_julian_day(date)
        # Convert it in Julian seconds since J2000
        date_J2000_sec = time_conversion.julian_day_to_seconds_since_epoch(date_J2000)
        # Check the date from the TCB scale to the TDB scale
        date_TDB_scale = time_conversion.TCB_to_TDB(date_J2000_sec)
        # Print the converted output
        print(date_TDB_scale)  # prints 698384439.9176273

classes:

    short_summary: "Class to store a calendar date and time of day, with high resolution."
    extended_summary: |
       Class to store a calendar date and time of day, with high resolution compared to Python datetime.datetime. This class
       stores the seconds as a ``long double`` variable in the C++ implementation, corresponding to about
       16 or 19 digits of precision (depending on the compiler used). In either case, this will be sufficient for sub-femtosecond
       resolution. In addition, this class allows easy conversion to typical time representations in astrodynamics (seconds since J2000,
       Julian day, and modified Julian day).
